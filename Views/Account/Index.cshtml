<h1>Sales Tracker</h1>
<h3>Build a sales tracker that uses AJAX calls to track inventory and sales for a small business. As a user we can:</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="BoldText, ItalicText">Login as a sales associate or a manager.</li>
    <li class="BoldText">As a sales associate I can perform the following actions on a single page using AJAX.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>see complete inventory to help customers</li>
        <li>make a sale, which reduces inventory and increases revenue</li>
        <li>process a return which returns an item to inventory and credits a refund</li>
        <li>see all of my sales, and make comments that only I can see</li>
        <li>calculate my commission based on my individual sales</li>
    </ul>
    <li class="BoldText">As a manager I can perform the following actions on a single page using AJAX</li>
    <ul>
        <li>see inventory AND costs for inventory items</li>
        <li>review and edit sales by all sales associates, to correct for errors</li>
        <li>view sales associate comments on sales</li>
        <li>see commission for all sales associates</li>
        <li>add or remove sales associates</li>
        <li>add new inventory for sale, including item cost and sale price</li>
        <li>see the total balance sheet for the entire store (revenue - costs = profit)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="ItalicText">Be sure to write unit tests for all of your actions. This is a good opportunity to practice using a mock database or a test database</p>
